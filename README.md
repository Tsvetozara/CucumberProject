In this maven project I have the general structure of a Cucumber BDD Project. 
I have organized it into 4 folders – “features”, “hooks”, “runner” and “stepdefinitions”. 
I have also added some additions such as Cucumber HTML report, pretty Cucumber option and I’ve used the common tags, data tables and tagged hooks.
